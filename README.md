 Following Measures was written to find % Returned Order
 
         % Returned Orders = VAR Percentage = 
    DIVIDE(
        DISTINCTCOUNT(Returns[Order ID]),
        DISTINCTCOUNT(Orders[Order ID])
    ) RETURN 
    FORMAT(Percentage, "Percent")

Following Measures was written to find Profit PY

    Profit PY = CALCULATE(
    [Profit],
    SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR( 'Date Table'[Date] ))
